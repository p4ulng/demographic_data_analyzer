# Demographic Data Analyzer
I edited the demographic_data_analyzer.py boilerplate file from freeCodeCamp to solve the . Other parts of the repository were coded by freeCodeCamp

On the Project:
Project requires analysis skills using Pandas to make sense of the 1994 Census Income dataset.
I used Pandas to answer the following questions:
-How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
-What is the average age of men?
-What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
-What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
-What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
-What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
-What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
-What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
-Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

The data visualizations will help me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

Project also involves reading the test_module.py to see what exactly is the project is asking for with regards to the accuracy desired for questions with numerical answers .
